# MCU-Programming-Bidirectional-LED-Runner-with-Switch-Control-AVR-
This project demonstrates a switch-controlled LED sequence using an AVR microcontroller. When the switch is pressed, LEDs connected to PORTF light up in **reverse order** (right to left). When the switch is not pressed, they light up in **forward order** (left to right).
